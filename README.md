Hi there! I'm an **indie game developer** living my best (almost) life, one line of code at a time. 🎮✨  
I love turning ideas into games, designing immersive experiences, and occasionally debugging until 3 AM.

- 🎮 **Game Developer:** I specialize in creating 2D and 3D (not too deep into it yet) games using Unity and Construct(sometimes).  
- 🎨 **Creative Designer:** I use Photoshop to design game assets, UI, and promotional materials.  
- ☕ **Code Enthusiast:** Whether it's C# or Java, I’m always up for writing clean, efficient code.  
- 🌟 **Fun Fact:** My debugging skills improve exponentially after midnight. (until my game's afk grinding finally finishes)
